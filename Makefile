#
#	Makefile for the project skeleton.
#
#	This Makefile is the human-facing driver.
#	Each rule calls the appropriate tool instead of reimplementing work:
#		all:    the project's primary artifact (a cheap no-op when current)
#		build:  sh scripts/site-build.sh
#		site:   sh scripts/site-build.sh + sh scripts/site-condense.sh
#		        (the standard page set; see prompts/features/02-project-pages.md)
#		state:  sh scripts/site-state-fetch.sh (refresh the live state file;
#		        run on the owning host)
#		check:  validate generated output (the leak gate over site.out/);
#		        a pipeline project extends this with its own validation mode
#		release: sh scripts/release-package.sh (the files a release publishes)
#		clean:  rm -rf generated output (keeps .gitkeep placeholders)
#		test:   npm test
#		deploy: RETIRED - all publishing to labs.bannister.us goes through
#		        the homelab project (homelab-publish; see the homelab's
#		        documents/09-project-pages-conventions.md). This target
#		        only reminds you of that; use the homelab's make deploy.
#		install: reserved; not yet defined.
#
#	A data pipeline names each rule for the file it produces, adds an `all`
#	target that is a cheap no-op when current, keeps work products unless
#	`--refresh` is asked for, and preserves raw caches; see
#	prompts/03-conventions.md 6.3.
