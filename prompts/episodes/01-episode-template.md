## Filled Example

This example shows the worked Site Build feature as an episode.

It is illustrative; it is not dispatched as-is.

[EPISODE]
Implement the Site Build feature from `prompts/features/01-site-build.md`.

[ACCEPTANCE]
- Does `scripts/site-build.sh` generate `site.out/` from `site.in/`?
- Does `make test` pass from the repository root?
- Is the diff reviewable in one sitting?

[RISK]
- Is `sh` available in the target environment?
- Do the tests avoid generated output in source directories?

[SUB-TASKS]
- Create `scripts/site-build.sh`.
- Create `site.in/hello.txt`.
- Add tests in `tests/`.
- Run `make test`.

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Report the created files and the result of `make test`.

[FILES]

- `site.in/hello.txt` — new
