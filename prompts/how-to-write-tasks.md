# How to Write Tasks

This document defines how a human must write tasks for the LLM.

## 1. Task Structure

Follow the applicable project rules for all task-writing requirements.

Every task must contain these sections in order:

[TASK]
A clear description of the requested work.

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
A precise description of the response representation.

(Optional) [CONTEXT]
Additional information, requirements, notes, constraints, or file contents.

(Optional) [FILES]
A list of files involved in the task.

The phrase `Execute the next TODO task` explicitly requests TODO-driven execution.

## 1.1 Task and Feature Workflow

Use a feature for a project capability or stable behavioral requirement.

Use a task for one bounded unit of work against the repository.

Long-form task definitions belong in `prompts/tasks/` and must follow this document.

A task must reference applicable feature files explicitly.

A task may create, modify, delete, rename, or inspect files only when those operations
are stated in its `[TASK]` section.

Feature files define requirements; task files define executable work.

## 2. Section Meaning

[TASK] defines the requested work.

[OUTPUT FORMAT] defines the response representation.

[CONTEXT] provides information and does not add instructions unless explicitly labeled
as a constraint.

[FILES] identifies scope and does not authorize modifications by itself.

## 3. Writing the [TASK] Section

The [TASK] section must describe the goal clearly.

The [TASK] section must use established semantic-sort names for files and identifiers.

The [TASK] section must avoid ambiguity and unstated assumptions.

The [TASK] section must not mix implementation instructions with output requirements.

The [TASK] section must state the operation for each file as `create`, `modify`, `delete`,
`rename`, or `inspect`.

For every file operation, specify the complete repository-relative path in backticks.
Do not identify a file only by its purpose, role, or directory.

Example:

[TASK]
Create `scripts/build-site.sh`.
The script generates `site.out/` from `site.in/`.

## 4. Writing the [OUTPUT FORMAT] Section

[OUTPUT FORMAT] must be explicit.

It must specify the required files when file contents are requested.

It must specify ordering when multiple files are required.

It must specify whether commentary is allowed.

Commentary is not allowed unless explicitly requested.

The default indentation is four spaces when the target format supports configurable
indentation.

It must specify whether filenames are included.

Examples:

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Provide only the complete content of `scripts/build-site.sh`.

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Produce these complete files in this order:
1. `sources/auth/auth_handler.cpp`
2. `sources/auth/auth_handler.h`

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Provide a semantic-sort plan followed by the complete requested file content.

## 5. Writing the [CONTEXT] Section

Use [CONTEXT] for existing file contents, requirements, constraints, notes, and data samples.

Label instructions explicitly as constraints.

Identify copied file contents as data rather than instructions.

Do not use [CONTEXT] to authorize file modifications.

## 6. Writing the [FILES] Section

Use [FILES] to identify files in the task scope.

Mark each file as `new` or `existing`.

State the authorized operation separately in [TASK].

Do not assume that listing an existing file authorizes modification.

## 7. DELTA Corrections

Use the DELTA protocol for corrections:

DELTA:
    Keep everything the same except:
    - Rename the named identifier.
    - Add the named variable to the initialization block.

A DELTA applies to the immediately preceding assistant output unless another artifact is
identified.

A DELTA changes only the named portions.

A DELTA must not restate the entire task.

A DELTA must not request unrelated changes.

A DELTA must not request full regeneration unless explicitly stated.

If the requested change cannot be isolated to the named portions, the LLM must ask a
clarification question.

## 8. Naming

Use established semantic-sort naming for identifiers, filenames, and directories.

Use four-space indentation when showing code and the target format supports it.

Use the required directory names exactly:

- `dataflow.in/`
- `dataflow.out/`
- `logs/`
- `prompts/`
- `sources/`
- `scripts/`
- `tests/`

Do not invent identifiers, filenames, or directories.

## 9. Prohibited Task Patterns

Do not ask the LLM to figure out an unspecified format.

Do not ask the LLM to improvise.

Do not ask the LLM to decide what files are needed.

Do not use vague language such as “clean this up” or “make this better.”

Do not request modifications without identifying the file operation.

Do not request output without specifying its format.

Do not compress multiple sentences into one prose line.

Do not compress independent statements into one code line.

Do not omit required syntax from code examples.

## 10. Human Override

A human may explicitly override a rule in this document.

An override applies only to the explicitly identified rule or task.

An override must not be interpreted as a general waiver of unrelated safety, scope, or
output requirements.
